      question: 'What is stablecoin? What is the use of stablecoins?',
      answer: 'Stablecoin is an encrypted digital currency of which the purchasing power can remain relatively stable. Suppose that a digital currency is anchored to the US dollar (a fiat of which the purchasing power is relatively stable) by technical means, namely the price of one coin always worth 1 US dollar, then this digital currency can be considered as a stablecoin. The stability of purchasing power is achieved through indirect means which is effective at this stage. Stablecoins can be used in the field of payments in physical world, digital asset exchanges, blockchain-based financial services and the entire blockchain eco-economy.',

However, with the advancement of the Alchemint’s roadmap, the financial and commercial ecosystem based on stablecoins will gradually improve and SDUSD will gradually evolve onto a proactive way to maintain purchasing power. Thus SDUSD will become the standard currency of the entire blockchain economy.'
